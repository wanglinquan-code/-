  <h1>HTML Webpack Plugin</h1>
  <p>Plugin that simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your bundles</p>
</div>

<h2 align="center">Install</h2>


```bash
  npm i --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
```

```bash
  yarn add --dev html-webpack-plugin
```



This is a [webpack](http://webpack.js.org/) plugin that simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your `webpack` bundles. This is especially useful for `webpack` bundles that include a hash in the filename which changes every compilation. You can either let the plugin generate an HTML file for you, supply
your own template using `lodash` templates or use your own loader.

### `Plugins`

The `html-webpack-plugin` provides [hooks](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin#events) to extend it to your needs. There are already some really powerful plugins which can be integrated with zero configuration

 * [webpack-subresource-integrity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-subresource-integrity) for enhanced asset security
 * [appcache-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/lettertwo/appcache-webpack-plugin) for iOS and Android offline usage
 * [favicons-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/favicons-webpack-plugin) which generates favicons and icons for iOS, Android and desktop browsers
 * [html-webpack-harddisk-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-harddisk-plugin) can be used to always write to disk the html file, useful when webpack-dev-server / HMR are being used
 * [html-webpack-inline-source-plugin](https://github.com/DustinJackson/html-webpack-inline-source-plugin) to inline your assets in the resulting HTML file
 * [html-webpack-inline-svg-plugin](https://github.com/thegc/html-webpack-inline-svg-plugin) to inline SVGs in the resulting HTML file.
 * [html-webpack-exclude-assets-plugin](https://github.com/jamesjieye/html-webpack-exclude-assets-plugin) for excluding assets using regular expressions
 * [html-webpack-include-assets-plugin](https://github.com/jharris4/html-webpack-include-assets-plugin) for including lists of js or css file paths (such as those copied by the copy-webpack-plugin).
 * [script-ext-html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/numical/script-ext-html-webpack-plugin) to add `async`, `defer` or `module` attributes to your `<script>` elements, or even inline them
 * [style-ext-html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/numical/style-ext-html-webpack-plugin) to convert your `<link>`s to external stylesheets into `<style>` elements containing internal CSS
 * [resource-hints-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/resource-hints-webpack-plugin) to add resource hints for faster initial page loads using `<link rel='preload'>` and `<link rel='prefetch'>`
 * [preload-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/preload-webpack-plugin) for automatically wiring up asynchronous (and other types) of JavaScript chunks using `<link rel='preload'>` helping with lazy-loading
 * [link-media-html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/yaycmyk/link-media-html-webpack-plugin) allows for injected stylesheet `<link />` tags to have their media attribute set automatically; useful for providing specific desktop/mobile/print etc. stylesheets that the browser will conditionally download
 * [inline-chunk-manifest-html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jouni-kantola/inline-chunk-manifest-html-webpack-plugin) for inlining webpack's chunk manifest. Default extracts manifest and inlines in `<head>`
 * [html-webpack-inline-style-plugin](https://github.com/djaax/html-webpack-inline-style-plugin) for inlining styles to HTML elements using [juice](https://github.com/Automattic/juice). Useful for email generation automatisation.
 * [html-webpack-exclude-empty-assets-plugin](https://github.com/KnisterPeter/html-webpack-exclude-empty-assets-plugin) removes empty assets from being added to the html. This fixes some problems with extract-text-plugin with webpack 4.
 * [webpack-concat-plugin](https://github.com/hxlniada/webpack-concat-plugin) for concat and uglify files that needn't to be webpack bundles(for legacy files) and inject to html-webpack-plugin.
 

<h2 align="center">Usage</h2>

The plugin will generate an HTML5 file for you that includes all your `webpack`
bundles in the body using `script` tags. Just add the plugin to your `webpack`
config as follows:

**webpack.config.js**
```js
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')

module.exports = {
  entry: 'index.js',
  output: {
    path: __dirname + '/dist',
    filename: 'index_bundle.js'
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin()
  ]
}
```

This will generate a file `dist/index.html` containing the following

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Webpack App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="index_bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

If you have multiple `webpack` entry points, they will all be included with
